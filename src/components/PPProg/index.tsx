      </Heading>
      <Text>
        The Professional Preparation Program has been a transformative journey
        that has equipped me with essential skills and experiences necessary for
        career readiness. Throughout this program, I have engaged deeply in
        three core areas: financial literacy, Micro MBA & immersion experiences,
        and the development of a professional disposition using the CASVE model.
        These components have not only enhanced my technical expertise but also
        fostered personal growth and strategic career planning. Reflecting on my
        experiences, I have gained invaluable insights and practical knowledge
        that have prepared me to navigate challenges and contribute effectively
        in today's dynamic professional landscape.

      <Text>
        Throughout the program, I have acquired essential skills in financial
        literacy. This includes mastering personal financial management
        techniques and navigating complex financial strategies within business
        contexts. The program's emphasis on financial literacy has equipped me

      <Heading size={"sm"}>Micro MBA & Immersion:</Heading>
      <Text>
        The Micro MBA component of the program has significantly enhanced my
        business acumen and project management skills. Through Micro MBA, I have
        developed comprehensive project proposals (PIP/PBP) outlining strategic
        initiatives with potential for significant impact. These skills have
        broadened my understanding of business operations and prepared me to
        tackle real-world challenges with confidence and innovation.

        In addition to Micro MBA, the program's immersion experiences have been
        transformative. These opportunities have allowed me to apply theoretical
        knowledge gained in the classroom to practical scenarios. By engaging
        directly with industry practices and challenges, I have developed
        practical skills and a deeper understanding of implementing Micro MBA
        strategies in diverse organizational settings.

      <Heading size={"sm"}>Professional Disposition:</Heading>
      <Text>
        The program has also focused on developing a professional disposition
        grounded in the CASVE model. This structured approach has guided me in
        developing a clear career path aligned with my skills, values, and
        aspirations. By applying the principles of CASVE (Communication,
        Analysis, Synthesis, Valuing, and Execution), I have been able to chart
        a course that ensures continuous growth and alignment with my long-term
        career goals.

        Reflecting on my journey throughout the program, these experiences have
        not only enhanced my technical skills but also fostered personal growth
        and professional development. The activities in financial literacy have
        empowered me to make sound financial decisions and understand the
        financial landscape in various business contexts. The Micro MBA and
        immersion experiences have sharpened my problem-solving abilities and
        provided insights into effective project management and industry
        practices. Moreover, aligning my career path using the CASVE model has
        enabled me to set clear objectives and pursue opportunities that
        resonate with my aspirations. Overall, these reflections underscore the
